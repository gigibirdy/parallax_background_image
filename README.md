# Parallax Image

This was an interview question from my most recent interview. The idea was intended to scroll the image background inside a widget while user is scrolling down the webpage. The proportion or speed of images revealed can be adjusted. In this project, I set to start scrolling background image while user starts scrolling down the webpage and reveal the bottom of the image while the window hits the bottom of the document.
